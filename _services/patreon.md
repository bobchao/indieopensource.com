Patreon provides a platform for receiving recurring donations, optionally in exchange for listed perks.

Most open source developers who receive significant donations via Patreon offer advertising in the form of listings in sponsor-list files, websites, and documentation.  See [Evan You](https://patreon.com/evanyou) [Sindre Sorhus](https://patreon.com/sindresorhus), and [Henry Zhu](https://patreon.com/henryzhu).  Some developers offer other perks, like early access to security advisories.  See [Eran Hammer](https://patreon.com/eranhammer).
