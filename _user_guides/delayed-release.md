Delayed release is a business model that open source developers use to support their work.

Delayed release projects publish some of their work as soon as it's done, but hold other work back for delayed release.  Paying customers get access to work that's held back immediate.  Everyone else gets access to that work after a set period of time, usually months or weeks.
