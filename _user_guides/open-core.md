Open core is a business model that open source developers use to support their work.

Open core developers release the functional "core" of their software under an open source software license.  Typically, that license gives you or your company all the permission needed to use the software.

For additional needs, open core developers sell licenses for additional functionality---extra features, plugins, management utilities, companion tools---that increase the value of the core software.
