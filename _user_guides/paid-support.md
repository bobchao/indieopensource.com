Finding open source software online does not guarantee that anyone will be there to answer questions, fix bugs, or advise on applications.  Nearly all common open source licenses disclaim all warranties, leaving you without any guarantee that the software will work, or that someone will be there to help when it doesn't.

Paid support allows you or your company to hire open source developers to provide timely, expert help with their open source software.
