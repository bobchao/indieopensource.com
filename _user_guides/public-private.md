Public-private licensing is a business model that open source software developers have used to support their work for decades.

Everyone is free to use the open source software under the terms of a copyleft license, like the GNU General Public License.  Generally speaking, the copyleft license gives permission to run, change, and share the project, but not to build closed or proprietary software with it.

At the same time, the developer sells private licenses, specific to one customer at a time, to build closed or proprietary software with the project.  License fees support the developer, so they can otherwise make the project free.
